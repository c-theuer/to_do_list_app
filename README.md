# ðŸ“¦ To Do List App 
```

A simple webapp that allows users to keep track of their to dos. It is intended to meet the following requirements:
- Let users create new tasks and tag them with categories 
- Display all to-dos and let the user mark completed tasks as done
- Let users add a deadline for each task 
- Filter to-dos by category 

## Demo App

## Notes on Development

- I aimed to do an MVP that just meets the requirements stated.
- All of this code was generated by prompting Claude 4.5 Sonnet within PyCharm.
- I read the code for correctness, but only made changes by prompting the AI.
- The code stores its data in session variables, so every time you restart, all data is lost.
- I decided not to add a database for just a demo.
- No authentication, security, or unit tests.
